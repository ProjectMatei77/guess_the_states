 U.S. States Guessing Game
This is a Python game using Turtle and Pandas, where the player must guess all 50 U.S. states by entering their names. 
The guessed states will be displayed on a U.S. map. 
If the player quits, a CSV file (states_to_learn.csv) is created with the missing states to help with learning.

How to Play
Run the script.
A U.S. map appears.
Type the name of a U.S. state in the pop-up text box.
If correct, the state's name appears on the map at its correct location.
Continue guessing until you get all 50 states or type "Exit" to stop.
If you exit early, a CSV file (states_to_learn.csv) is generated with the missing states.
